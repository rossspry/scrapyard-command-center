# Next (Prioritized)

1. Move Frigate compose+config into `infra/frigate` and add deploy script (2 cams only).
2. Stabilize red-border/live pipeline if still present after git-managed config.
3. ONNX GPU detector migration for Frigate (enables better LPR).
4. Expand cameras 2 → 10 using split-stream pattern.
5. Implement SCC rule engine v1 (notify-only default, manual announce toggle, business hours).
