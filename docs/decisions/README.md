# Architectural decisions

Use this directory to record noteworthy decisions (akin to Architecture Decision Records). Start new files using the pattern `NNNN-title.md` where `NNNN` is a zero-padded sequence number.

Each record should answer:
1. **Context:** What problem or constraint are we addressing?
2. **Decision:** What option did we choose and why?
3. **Consequences:** What follow-up work or trade-offs exist?

Keeping these records current helps future contributors understand why the system looks the way it does.
